        // EXPLANATION
        // This problem is tricky and does not have a clear perfect solution without trade-offs.
        // Playcounts are retained in history, but the files on the disk can get added or deleted,
        // which means the first listen through the full album can include 10 tracks, then 3 tracks
        // get deleted, and suddenly the next 5 listens are on 7 tracks. Then a track gets added
        // back in and the next 2 listens are on 8 tracks. You get the point. There is no way of
        // determining what the "true" number of tracks on an album is.
        //
        // After thinking about it a lot, I decided the following things:
        // 1) Assume the album does not change, or changes very rarely.
        // 2) Consider the full album length to be the number of files present on the disk.
        // 3) Ignore album tracks which are present only in the playcount, i.e. they were deleted.
        //
        // Rationale: For an album listen to count, at least half of its tracks must be played.
        // What happens commonly is that I will import a full album, listen through it, delete some
        // songs I don't like. With the above assumptions, deleting anything off the album does not
        // change the fact that it was listened through once. Moreover, any subsequent listens to
        // this trimmed-down album will be counted as full listens as well, because the deleted
        // tracks are no longer considered as part of the full album length.
        // The only trouble could arise if a large number of deleted tracks was brought back.
        // For example, if I did 10 listens of a 5-track album, and suddenly the album becomes
        // 11-track-long, all 5 of those listens will not count as album listens anymore. However,
        // these kinds of situations are rather extreme and should be very rare. It is more likely
        // that only a few tracks would be brought back, which would not affect the previous album
        // listens from losing their relevance.
